# Age and Gender Detection

## Overview
This project implements deep learning models for age and gender detection using facial images. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify gender and estimate age from input images.

## Features
- Gender classification: Predicts the gender (male/female) of a person in the input image.
- Age estimation: Estimates the age of a person in the input image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/age-gender-detection.git
   cd age-gender-detection
